## Contributing

If you create improved schematics or PCB designs:
1. Follow standard electrical symbols
2. Label all components clearly
3. Include bill of materials (BOM)
4. Test before sharing
5. Submit via pull request

## Notes

- Always double-check connections before powering on
- Use appropriate wire gauge for current requirements
- Include fuses for protection
- Add decoupling capacitors near ICs
- Keep signal and power lines separated
