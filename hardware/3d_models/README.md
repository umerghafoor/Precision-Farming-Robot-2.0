## File Formats

Models are provided in:
- STL - For 3D printing
- STEP - For CAD editing
- F3D - Fusion 360 source files (when available)

## Printing Guidelines

### Recommended Settings
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20-30%
- Supports: As needed
- Material: PLA or PETG

### Material Recommendations
- **PLA**: Indoor use, easy to print
- **PETG**: Better durability, weather resistant
- **ABS**: High strength, requires heated bed
- **TPU**: Flexible parts (gaskets, dampeners)

### Post-Processing
- Remove supports carefully
- Sand rough edges
- Use acetone vapor for ABS smoothing
- Paint or coat for weather protection

## Design Software

Compatible with:
- Fusion 360
- Tinkercad
- Blender
- FreeCAD
- OpenSCAD

## Contributing Models

When contributing 3D models:
1. Test print before sharing
2. Include build instructions
3. Document material requirements
4. Specify support requirements
5. Add assembly photos if available

## Assembly Instructions

Detailed assembly guides for each component are available in the `docs/` folder.

## Customization

Feel free to modify designs for your specific needs:
- Adjust sizes for different motors
- Add mounting holes
- Modify sensor positions
- Create custom attachments

## Notes

- Check printer bed size before printing large parts
- Consider printing orientation for strength
- Some parts may require assembly
- Use appropriate adhesives (CA glue, epoxy)
- Weather protection recommended for outdoor use
