## ðŸŽ¯ Features Added

### 1. **Connection Status Indicator** (Main Window)

**Location:** Status bar (bottom-right corner)

**Description:** A persistent visual indicator showing the ROS2 connection status.

**Features:**
- **Green badge** (`ROS2: Connected`) when connected
- **Red badge** (`ROS2: Disconnected`) when not connected
- Color-coded for quick visual feedback
- Always visible in the status bar

**User Benefit:** Instant awareness of whether the robot is connected without needing to check elsewhere.

---

### 2. **FPS Counter** (Video Stream Widget)

**Location:** Video stream control bar (top-right)

**Description:** Real-time frame rate display for the camera feed.

**Features:**
- Shows current frames per second (e.g., `FPS: 29.5`)
- Updates every second
- Monospace font with green text on dark background
- Tracks frame times over a 2-second window

**User Benefit:** Monitor video stream performance and diagnose latency issues.

---

### 3. **Snapshot Capture** (Video Stream Widget)

**Location:** Video stream control bar

**Description:** Capture and save the current video frame as an image.

**Features:**
- ðŸ“· **Snapshot button** in the control bar
- Saves current frame to disk
- Automatic timestamp in filename (e.g., `snapshot_20251029_143022.png`)
- File dialog for choosing save location
- Supports PNG, JPG, and BMP formats

**User Benefit:** Quickly capture important moments during robot operation for documentation or analysis.

### 4. **Velocity Feedback Display** (Motion Control Widget)

**Location:** Motion control widget (below controls)

**Description:** Real-time display of commanded velocities.

**Features:**
- Shows **Linear velocity** in m/s
- Shows **Angular velocity** in rad/s
- Format: `Linear: 0.50 m/s | Angular: 0.25 rad/s`
- Updates in real-time as commands are sent
- Monospace font with green text on dark background

**User Benefit:** See exactly what commands are being sent to the robot, helping with debugging and control verification.

---

### 5. **Emergency Stop Keyboard Shortcut** (Motion Control Widget)

**Location:** Motion control widget (keyboard shortcut)

**Description:** Quick emergency stop using the spacebar.

**Features:**
- Press **SPACE** key to immediately stop the robot
- Clears any pinned motion commands
- Works when the motion control widget has focus
- Visual hint label: `ðŸ’¡ Tip: Press SPACE for emergency stop`

**User Benefit:** Quick safety mechanism to stop the robot instantly without needing to click the STOP button.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Principles

All buffer features follow these principles:

1. **Non-intrusive:** Features enhance without cluttering the UI
2. **Informative:** Provide useful feedback at a glance
3. **Accessible:** Easy to find and use
4. **Consistent:** Follow the same dark theme with green accents
5. **Safe:** Emergency features are clearly marked and easily accessible

## ðŸš€ Usage Tips

### For Video Monitoring:
- Check the **FPS counter** to ensure smooth video streaming (aim for >20 FPS)
- Use **Snapshot** to capture important frames during operation
- Monitor the **connection status** indicator to ensure stable ROS2 link

### For Robot Control:
- Watch the **velocity feedback** to confirm commands are being sent
- Use **SPACE key** for quick emergency stops
- The **STOP button** also clears pinned commands

### For General Operation:
- Keep an eye on the **ROS2 connection indicator** in the status bar
- Green = ready to go, Red = need to connect first

## ðŸ“Š Technical Details

### FPS Calculation
- Tracks frame timestamps in a rolling 2-second window
- Calculates FPS as: `(frame_count - 1) * 1000 / time_span_ms`
- Updates display every 1000ms

### Snapshot Format
- Default format: PNG (lossless compression)
- Timestamp format: `yyyyMMdd_hhmmss`
- Supports saving to any user-selected location

### Velocity Display
- Precision: 2 decimal places
- Updates immediately when motion commands change
- Resets to 0.00 on stop

## ðŸ”§ Future Enhancements (Potential)

Consider these additional buffer features for future updates:

- Battery level indicator (if robot sends battery data)
- Network latency display
- Quick bookmarks for snapshot locations
- Video recording indicator with elapsed time
- Odometry/position display
- Command history log
