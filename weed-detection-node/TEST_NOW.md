## üîß FIXED - Docker Networking Issue

**Problem:** Containers couldn't discover each other using `--network host`

**Solution:** Using custom Docker network + proper ROS2 environment variables

---

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP TEST (Follow Exactly!)

### Step 0: Setup (One Time Only)
```bash
cd /home/taha/Desktop/Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0/weed-detection-node
./setup_network.sh
./stop_all.sh
```

---

### Step 1: Terminal 1 - Processor
```bash
cd /home/taha/Desktop/Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0/weed-detection-node
./run_processor_docker.sh
```

**Wait for:**
```
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: ArUco Processor Node initialized
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Subscribing to: camera/raw
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Publishing to: camera/annotated, coordinates
```

**‚è±Ô∏è WAIT 5 SECONDS**

---

### Step 2: Terminal 2 - Publisher
```bash
cd /home/taha/Desktop/Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0/weed-detection-node
./run_publisher_docker.sh
```

**‚úÖ NOW Terminal 1 MUST show:**
```
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Received image: (720, 1280, 3)
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Detected 5 ArUco markers
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Published annotated image
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Published coordinates: 5 markers
```

**If you DON'T see this, something is still wrong - let me know!**

**‚è±Ô∏è WAIT 3 SECONDS**

---

### Step 3: Terminal 3 - Viewer
```bash
cd /home/taha/Desktop/Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0/weed-detection-node
./run_viewer_docker.sh
```

**‚úÖ Should show:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1761843849,
  "markers": [
    {"id": 4, "center": {"x": 854, "y": 554}, ...},
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

## What Changed?

1. **Custom Docker Network** - Containers on `ros2_network` instead of `host`
2. **ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0** - Allows inter-container communication
3. **RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp** - Better discovery
4. **Same ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0** - All on same domain

---

## If Still Not Working

Run diagnostic:
```bash
./check_topics.sh
```

This will show if nodes can see each other.

---

**Please follow the steps above EXACTLY and tell me if Terminal 1 shows "Received image"!**
