# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX - Rebuild Required

## ❌ Problem: ROS2 Version Mismatch

Your **desktop-client** uses **ROS2 Jazzy**, but the weed-detection-node was built with **ROS2 Humble**.

This causes communication errors:
```
xmlrpc.client.ResponseError: ResponseError("unknown tag 'rclpy.type_hash.TypeHash'")
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated Dockerfile to use **ROS2 Jazzy** (same as desktop-client).

---

## 🚀 REBUILD NOW

Run this command to rebuild with the fix:

```bash
cd /home/taha/Desktop/Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0/weed-detection-node
./rebuild_docker.sh
```

This will rebuild the Docker image with:
- ✅ ROS2 Jazzy (matches desktop-client)
- ✅ NumPy <2.0 (cv_bridge compatibility)
- ✅ OpenCV API compatibility

---

## After Rebuild - Test Again

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
./run_processor_docker.sh
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
./run_publisher_docker.sh
```

**Terminal 3:**
```bash
./run_viewer_docker.sh
```

---

## Expected Output (All Working!)

```
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: ArUco Processor Node initialized
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Subscribing to: camera/raw
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Publishing to: camera/annotated, coordinates
[INFO] [aruco_processor]: Detected 5 ArUco markers ✓
```

No more errors! 🎉
