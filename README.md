# Precision Farming Robot 2.0

An advanced autonomous farming robot system designed for precision agriculture applications.

## Project Overview

The Precision Farming Robot 2.0 is a comprehensive robotics platform that combines hardware, firmware, software, and mobile/desktop applications to enable autonomous farming operations. The system leverages ROS2 for advanced navigation and control, providing both remote operation and autonomous capabilities.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into the following components:

### ü§ñ [Raspberry Pi Code](./raspberry-pi/)
Contains the main control software that runs on the Raspberry Pi, handling sensor data acquisition, motor control, and system coordination.

### üîß [Firmware](./firmware/)
Low-level firmware for microcontrollers managing real-time motor control, sensor interfacing, and communication protocols.

### üì± [Mobile App](./mobile-app/)
Mobile application for remote control, real-time monitoring, and field data visualization.

### üñ•Ô∏è [Desktop Client (Digital Twin)](./desktop-client/)
Desktop application providing a digital twin visualization, simulation capabilities, and mission planning tools.

### üöÄ [ROS2](./ros2/)
ROS2 packages implementing navigation, path planning, sensor fusion, and autonomous operation modes.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance using ROS2
- **Precision Control**: Accurate positioning and movement for farming operations
- **Remote Monitoring**: Real-time data visualization through mobile and desktop apps
- **Digital Twin**: Virtual representation for simulation and testing
- **Modular Design**: Independently deployable components for flexibility

## Getting Started
