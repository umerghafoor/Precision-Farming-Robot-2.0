# Precision Farming Robot 2.0

An intelligent autonomous robot designed for precision agriculture, capable of monitoring crop health, soil conditions, and performing automated farming tasks.

## 🌱 Overview

The Precision Farming Robot 2.0 is an advanced agricultural robot that uses sensors and computer vision to optimize farming operations. It can:

- Monitor soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels
- Detect plant health and disease
- Navigate autonomously through crop rows
- Collect and log environmental data
- Perform precision watering and fertilization
- Generate real-time farming insights

## 🚀 Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: GPS-guided path planning with obstacle avoidance
- **Multi-Sensor Integration**: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH sensors
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Data collection and wireless transmission
- **Computer Vision**: Plant health detection using camera modules
- **Energy Efficient**: Solar panel support with battery management
- **Modular Design**: Easy to customize and extend functionality
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development
