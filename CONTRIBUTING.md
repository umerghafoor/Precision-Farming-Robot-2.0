# Contributing to Precision Farming Robot 2.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Precision Farming Robot project! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue with:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Hardware setup details
- Code version/commit hash

### Suggesting Enhancements

We love new ideas! When suggesting enhancements:
- Explain the feature and its benefits
- Describe how it would work
- Consider backward compatibility
- Provide example use cases

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umerghafoor/Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0.git
   cd Precision-Farming-Robot-2.0
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Test your changes thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide clear description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include test results

## Coding Standards

### Arduino/C++ Code

- Use descriptive variable names
- Comment complex algorithms
- Follow existing naming conventions:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Variables: `camelCase`

Example:
```cpp
// Good
void readSensorData() {
  int soilMoisture = analogRead(SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN);
  // Process data...
}

// Avoid
void rsd() {
  int sm = analogRead(0);
}
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for major features
- Add API documentation for new functions
- Include examples for new modules
- Use clear, concise language

### Testing

Before submitting:
- Test on actual hardware if possible
- Verify code compiles without warnings
- Check memory usage (especially on Arduino)
- Test edge cases
